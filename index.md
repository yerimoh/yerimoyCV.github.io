## Research Interests

- AI4Science   
- multimodal learning

My current research focuses on solving real-world scientific problems using artificial intelligence. Specifically, I’m interested in AI4Science, particularly in applying deep learning techniques to inorganic materials modeling. I also explore multimodal learning, with an emphasis on understanding and reasoning over video data through large language models. I aim to contribute to the advancement of AI technologies that bridge the gap between complex scientific data and human-level understanding, ultimately fostering progress in both science and society.
